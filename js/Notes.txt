let board = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''];
// represents the state of the squares on the board
// first '' = idx 0= top left sqr, 2nd '' = idx 1=top middle sqr, idx=3=middle left sqr

let turn = x;
// track whose turn it is, X = player X and O = player O

let winner = false;
// false winner means that theres no winner yet and true represents a player has won
// once winner is true we can determine which player won by whose turn it was when the winning move was played

let tie = false;
//A true value in tie will mean that the board array contains no more empty strings ('') and will be used to render a tie message if winner is still false by the time all squares are played.
